# Movies-ETL.

## Overview of Project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazing Prime wants to keep a dataset updated on a daily basis. In this challenge I created an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. I refactored an earlier version of the code to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
